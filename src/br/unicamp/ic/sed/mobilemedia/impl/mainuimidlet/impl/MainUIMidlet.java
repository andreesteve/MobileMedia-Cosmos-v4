 * It contains all the basic functionality that should be executable
 * in any standard J2ME device that supports MIDP 1.0 or higher. 
 * Any additional J2ME features for this application that are dependent
 * upon a particular device (ie. optional or proprietary library) are
 * de-coupled from the core application so they can be conditionally included
 * depending on the target platform 
 * 
 * This Application provides a basic Photo Album interface that allows a user to view
 * images on their mobile device.
